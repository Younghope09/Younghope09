I'm a passionate and goal-oriented student of the ALX SE with the aim of specializing in Back-end developement. As a learner, I'm open to collaborate with like-minded people who are pursuing their carriers in the same fields.
I have basic knowledge of some programming languages lige python, C, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
